`@script`
Welcome to the first objective in this course -- extracting data from SQLite to a pandas dataframe.


---
## pandas dataframe

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "8c2aceaa1c"
```

`@part1`
__Dataframe object__

- fast
- efficient
- manipulate/merge/join datasets 
- structured data


`@script`
The pandas library for Python provides a fast and efficient tool for manipulating, merging, and joining data sets. This is done with the Dataframe object - which contains structured data in a format similar to a spreadsheet or csv file.


---
## SQLite

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "505072b1e0"
```

`@part1`
- Self-contained & full-featured

- Portable

- Ready to run

- Database in a single file


`@script`
SQLite is a self-contained & full-featured SQL database engine.  It is extremely portable and ready to run without installation or configuration.  This makes it a popular choice for many applications.  The entire database is stored in a single file which can easily be transported and analyzed on different machines.

## pandas sample code

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "d236c2ed08"
```

`@part1`
```
#import libraries
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

#connect to database file
c = sqlite3.connect("database.sqlite")

#create dataframe using 'read_sql_query'
df_play = pd.read_sql_query("select * from players limit 25;",c)

#check the dataframe
df_play.head(10) 
```


`@script`
sqlite3 is a Python library - a database api tool that allows connections to and manipulations of a SQLite database.  
After importing the necessary libraries - pandas & sqlite3 - we start by establishing a connection to the database file itself. Then we can use the 'read sql query' command to create a dataframe from the results of an SQL query.  In this example, we are getting the top twenty-five records from the players table.

## End of Objective

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "23611838cd"
